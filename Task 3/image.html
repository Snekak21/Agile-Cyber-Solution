        <span class="aaa">The Lotus</span> is an aquatic plant that is native 
        to Southeast and East Asia. The scientific name of the
        lotus is Nelumbo Nucifera. It is also referred to as Indian 
        lotus or sacred lotus. Lotus plants grow in stationery water
        bodies like ponds and lakes. They also grow in muddy,
        slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Lotus flowers are usually
        white or light pink in colour and look very beautiful.
       </p>
       <p>Lotus leaves are large and circular. 
        This flower is considered sacred in Hinduism as well as
         Buddhism and has a lot of religious, cultural and
        historical significance. It represents purity, knowledge
        and spiritual awakening. 
        Lotus is the national flower of India. </p>
        <p>Lotus blossoms are very beautiful and have a lot of petals.
             Some Chinese lotuses can have around 3000 petals in
              one flower while a Japanese variety known as 
              “the strange lotus” 
            can have up to 5000 petals.</p>
